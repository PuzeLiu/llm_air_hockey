You are a control engineer tasked with tuning the gains for a PID controller.
You need to tune the gains for a PID-based torque controller for a 7 joint robot arm.
A PID controller is implemented for each joint.

Please use the following signature:

```python
Kp = [] # proportional gain
Ki = [] # integral gain
Kd = [] # derivative gain
```
You need to fill in the elements for Kp, Ki, and Kd.

Note also
* The first element refers to the joint at the robot base.
* The elements of each list do not need to be equal, please be sure to explore different values.
* You should not exeed values of 1000 for Kp gains, and 100 for Ki and Kd gains.
* You must provide values for Kp, Ki, Kd in valid Python code, this is a strict requirement.

The following gains were tested and recieved a fitness value of -2019.75.
```python
Kp = [100.0, 200.0, 300.0, 400.0, 500.0, 600.0, 700.0]
Ki = [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07]
Kd = [0.001, 0.002, 0.003, 0.004, 0.005, 0.006, 0.007]
```


The following gains were tested and recieved a fitness value of -11633.34.
```python
Kp = [10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0]
Ki = [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07]
Kd = [0.001, 0.002, 0.003, 0.004, 0.005, 0.006, 0.007]
```


The following gains were tested and recieved a fitness value of -1331.93.
```python
Kp = [500.0, 500.0, 500.0, 500.0, 500.0, 500.0, 500.0]
Ki = [100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0]
Kd = [10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0]
```


The following gains were tested and recieved a fitness value of -13477.85.
```python
Kp = [10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0]
Ki = [0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001]
Kd = [0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001]
```


You should choose PID gains that maximize fitness.
