Examples of solving similar tasks are shown below.

Example 1:
Task description: Put the two box_1 and box_2 into the bowl.
The code:
```python
def action_sequence():
    go_home()
    open_gripper()
    names_to_bowl = ["box_1", "box_2"]
    for name in names_to_bowl:
        reach_to_box(name)
        close_gripper()
        go_to_bowl()
        open_gripper()
        go_home()
```

Example 2:
Task description: stack box_2 on box_3.
The code:
```python
def action_sequence():
    go_home()
    open_gripper()
    reach_to_box("box_2")
    close_gripper()
    go_home()
    reach_to_box("box_3", zoffset=0.05)
    open_gripper()
    go_home()
```

Example 3:
Task description: Put the two box_1 and box_2 into the sink.
The code:
```python
def action_sequence():
    go_home()
    open_gripper()
    names_to_sink = ["box_1", "box_2"]
    for name in names_to_sink:
        reach_to_box(name)
        close_gripper()
        go_to_sink()
        open_gripper()
        go_home()
```
