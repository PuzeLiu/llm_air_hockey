Here is a history of previous experiments:
    Hitting angle: {{hit_angle}}
    Puck Final Position: {{puck_final_position}}
    Distance to the Goal: {{dist_to_goal}}

Assuming you are an expert playing air hockey, decide an offset angle based on the previous 
results to reduce the distance to the goal. 

Please use the following signature: 

```python
angle_offset = <value> # The offset value added to the hitting angle
```

Please also keep in mind the following:
* The goal position is {{goal_pos}}
