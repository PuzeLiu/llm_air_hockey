Please use the following signature:

```python
class angle_offset:
  value: float = <float> # The offset value added to the hitting angle (this should be a float)
```

An example of what what is expected from you to implement is as follows.
```python
class angle_offset:
  value: float = 0.03
```

The following is a history of previous experiments and their results:

The following angle_offset resulted in a final distance to goal of 0.10253570708551207.
```python
class angle_offset:
  value: float = 0.0
```

The following angle_offset resulted in a final distance to goal of 1.5001974105495772.
```python
class angle_offset:
  value: float = 1.57
```

Think about the results above when choosing a new value for the angle_offset.

Let's think step by step.

Please also keep in mind the following:
* The angle_offset value should be between -np.pi/2 and np.pi/2, values outside this range should be avoided.
* Do not use or create variables that do not exist.
* Only provide the value class variable for the angle_offset class, as above in the signature.
* The goal position is {{goal_pos}}.
* The angle_offset should be chosen such that the distance to goal is as small as possible.
* Do not explain your reasoning.
* It is a good idea to try out values that are not listed above in the results, unless they lead to a minimized distance to the goal.
